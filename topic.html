            Ruby is a simple and powerful open source programming language. It is an object oriented programming language and can be used to write servers, experiment with prototypes, and for everyday programming tasks. Some of the features of ruby are,

            The name “Ruby” was Influenced by Perl, Yukihiro Mastumoto wanted to use a jewel name for his new language, so he named it "Ruby" after a colleague’s birthstone. Later, he realized that Ruby comes right after Perl in several situations. In birthstones, pearl is June, ruby is July. When measuring font sizes, pearl is 5pt, ruby is 5.5pt. He thought Ruby was a good name for a newer programming language.

            Ruby was developed by a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer by the name 'Yukihiro Matsumoto'. It was a one man project in which he used already existing languages such as Smalltalk, Perl, Ada. He began his project in 1993 and released the first version to the public on the 21st of December 1995. This version was commonly referred to as version 0.95, and according to Yukihiro Matsumoto, his goal in creating the programming language was to make it more productive and enjoyable to work with when compared to the languages that existed during the time.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                
            Ruby has undergone several changes at several different points in time. Excluding 1993 and 1995, other significant time stamps that you may find noteworthy would be 1996 where version 1.0 was released, as well as the year 2000, which was when “Ruby on Rails’ made its first appearance. The following years showed the release of multiple versions of 1.0, such as 1.8 and 1.9, but in 2011 Ruby 2.0 made its debut. Two years later, Yukihiro Matsumoto made it clear that he was beginning to work on version 3.0. This version of ruby was released on the Christmas of 2020, and was known to have the biggest improvements in performance when compared to the other versions.

            As a framework, Ruby on Rails is exceptionally well-suited to the development of web applications.. This is apparent in the framework’s numerous code libraries (known as ‘Gems’ within the Ruby community) which provide free, open source code that developers can use to fulfil specific needs for a website or app.  They are ideal for keeping the costs down and speeding up the development of the project.
                
            </p>
        
            <p>
                
            Ruby on Rails is a full-stack framework. This means it provides everything a developer needs to build a web application, including the server-side back-end logic and the front-end user interface. As of December 2021, 418,000 global websites have been launched using Ruby on Rails development services.
            
            </p> 

            <p>
            
            There are several reasons why Rails has become a leader in custom web app development.

            Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. Since its inception, Ruby has gained a substantial following, particularly among web developers who use Ruby on Rails, a popular web application framework. The management of Ruby is handled by several groups, each with specific responsibilities.
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
            One of the key groups responsible for Ruby is the Ruby Core Team. They consist of several members of whom are responsible for the overall development of Ruby which includes language specification and implementation. They are also responsible for managing the Official Ruby website and ruby-lang.org which is the website that provides all the necessary information and resources about Ruby for developers. The Ruby Core Team is also given the responsibilities of coordinating with the other groups within the Ruby Community, such as the RubyGems team and the Rails team in order to keep the language relevant and up to date.
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
            The RubyGems team is responsible for package management for Ruby which makes it easier to install, manage and distribute Ruby libraries and applications to developers. They are also in charge of the official RubyGems repository and ensure that the RubyGems software is up to date and compatible with the latest versions of Ruby. The RubyGems team works with the Ruby Core Team to ensure that the latest tools and resources are available for developers to build robust and reliable applications.

            <p>
                
            There are many reasons for the decline of Ruby. One reason is that the language is not as popular as it used to be. Additionally, the language has been losing steam within the open-source community.
                
            </p>
        
            <p>
                
            Another reason for Ruby on Rails to decline is that there are newer, more modern frameworks that are gaining popularity such as Node.js has been gaining a lot of traction and is seen as a more modern option compared to Ruby on Rails.
                
            </p>
            
            <p>
                
            Lastly, Ruby on Rails' declining could be the lack of support from major companies. For example, Apple has never supported Ruby on Rails and instead has chosen to support other languages such as Swift.
